# Word and keywords

- Words which are not denfined and not reserved for javascript language that are not understandable by compiler
  called words.
- The reserved set of words that are understood by the javascript compiler called Keywords. we cannot use them, it will cause an error.

# Variables

- The place to store data and referred back with the name defined, they are like data containers to store data.
- in javascript we use ` var let and const` keywords to declare variables.
- variable declaration & assignment.
- var a; this is called declaration; a=12; this is called assignment.


# Differnce between var and let
- `var` variables  are `ES5 ` and `let, const` variables are newly added `ES6` features.
- `var` variables can be added to the window object by itself; where as `let` variables will not added to the window.
- `var` varibles are function scoped; where as `let` variables are braces `{},(),[]` scoped.
 - `var` can be hoisted ; let will not hoisted.
 -  `var` variables can be re-declared without any error;

# declaration and assignment 
 - declaring a variable called declaration `var number` and assigning with `=` assign operator is called assignment `number = 12`.


# undefined and  not defined;
- variables declared but not assigned any value called `undefined` and varibales not delcared called `not defined.`

# Hoisting
- variables and functions are hoisted,their declarations  will goes top of the code.
- `var` Variables declartion code will move to top.

# Types in JS
 - **Primitives** 
  - Number,String,Boolean,Null,undefined,symbol 
  - immutable values cannot be changed or copied  
  - if there are no brackets then they are primitives.
 - **Non-Primitives or Referrences** 
  - arrays,object,sets
  - if there are any kind of brakcet then they are called reffernces.


  # conditionals
  **`if else and else if`** are conditionals in  javascript. 
 - `if` is conditional check only executes when the conditon turns true;
  - `else if` this will re-runs the conditionals and checks conditions and returns only if it is true;

   - `else` this will be the default if everything turns false this will be executed.


# Loops
 - **for loop & while loop** 
 - loops will repeat the iterations desired number of times.
   - *for loops* will be initiated with the initial variable and there will be a check conditional 


# Functions
- there are 2 steps in functions; 
- function declaration and function calling

the set of code wants to re-use whenever we needed.
